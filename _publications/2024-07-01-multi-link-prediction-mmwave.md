In this work, we propose a hybrid approach combining Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict multi-link reliability and handover events in mmWave wireless communication systems. We further interpret the neural models using symbolic regression to extract explicit formulas relating channel state parameters to reliability. Our method reduces latency by 27% and demonstrates improved handover prediction performance, as reported in MDPI *Electronics* 2024.
