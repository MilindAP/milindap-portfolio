Hi there! I'm **Milind Patil**, a machine learning researcher and engineer based in Silicon Valley. My work spans multimodal learning, wireless AI, deep sequence models, and interpretability. I’m passionate about building systems that fuse heterogeneous sensor data (like Wi‑Fi CSI and vision) to enable robust human‑centric applications and reliable wireless communication.  

## Research & Industry  
- **Multimodal HAR using Wi-Fi CSI + Vision (2024–2025)** – Designed a unified inference pipeline that synchronizes time‑frequency CSI encodings with vision models (e.g. LLaVa/Falcon) and uses symbolic reasoning to recognize actions; integrated with an agentic alert system.  
- **Multi-Link Prediction for mmWave Systems (MDPI Electronics 2024)** – Proposed a Liquid Time‑Constant + LSTM hybrid for mmWave link reliability and handover prediction; used symbolic regression for interpretation; achieved latency reduction via quantization‑aware optimization.  
- **Acoustic Echo Cancellation** – Developed an LSTM‑based frequency–time echo suppression model improving performance by ~35%.  
- **Wireless Systems / RF Validation Engineer, Apple (Sept 2023 – Oct 2025)** – Validated 5G/LTE/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/GNSS subsystems for iPhones and iPads; performed protocol debugging (NSA/SA, PHY/MAC/RRC); automated validation using Python, SCPI, PyVISA; collaborated with manufacturing teams; performed RF optimization and coexistence analysis.  
- **RF Optimization Engineer, Reliance Jio (2017 – 2019)** – Optimized LTE/VoLTE KPIs via carrier aggregation and mobility tuning; analyzed drive‑test logs; resolved field issues using QXDM/QCAT.  

## Projects  
- **CSI‑Image Fusion Dataset** – Created a dataset of 20k samples capturing Wi‑Fi CSI and images for multimodal modeling.  
- **mmWave Beam Prediction Simulator** – Built a simulator to train and evaluate models for multi‑link prediction in mmWave networks, generating synthetic CSI/beam pairs under various channel conditions.  
- **Agentic HAR AI with Twilio Alerts** – Implemented a real-time human activity recognition agent using LLaVa and a rule-based reasoning engine; integrated Twilio to trigger emergency alerts.  

## Skills & Interests  
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, Transformers, LLaVa, sequence models, multimodal fusion  
- **Tools:** Python, MATLAB, CUDA, Linux, Twilio
