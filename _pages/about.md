## About Me
I am Milind Patil, a researcher working at the intersection of **AI/ML**, **wireless communication**, **CSI-based sensing**, and **next-generation mmWave/6G networks**.

I graduated with an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from **San Jose State University** and have experience working as a **Cellular Engineer** in Apple's Field Design Engineering team.

I am currently **seeking research roles** in AI/ML for Wireless, CSI Sensing, RF Systems, and mmWave/6G R&D.

## Research Interests
- CSI-based Human Activity Recognition  
- Multimodal Sensing (Vision + Wireless)  
- mmWave & Sub-THz Communications  
- Symbolic Regression for Wireless Systems  
- RF Desense & Interference Analysis  
- AI/ML for 5G/6G Networks
