<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

<p>
Below is a summary of my teaching and instructional experience at 
<strong>San Jose State University</strong> in the Department of Electrical Engineering.  
I have served as an <strong>Instructional Student Assistant (ISA)</strong> for multiple graduate-level EE courses in 
Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>
I believe in a hands-on, application-driven approach to teaching.  
My goal is to help students build strong intuition in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning & Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Computer Vision & AI Applications</li>
  <li>Python & MATLAB programming for engineers</li>
  <li>Deep Learning model design, debugging, and evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>
I emphasize conceptual clarity, real-world applicability, and strong 
technical communication in all my teaching roles.
